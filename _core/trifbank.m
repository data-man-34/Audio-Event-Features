function [ H, f, c ] = trifbank( M, K, R, fs, h2w, w2h )
% TRIFBANK Triangular filterbank.
%
%   [H,F,C]=TRIFBANK(M,K,R,FS,H2W,W2H) returns matrix of M triangular filters 
%   (one per row), each K coefficients long along with a K coefficient long 
%   frequency vector F and M+2 coefficient long cutoff frequency vector C. 
%   The triangular filters are between limits given in R (Hz) and are 
%   uniformly spaced on a warped scale defined by forward (H2W) and backward 
%   (W2H) warping functions.
%
%   Inputs
%           M is the number of filters, i.e., number of rows of H
%
%           K is the length of frequency response of each filter 
%             i.e., number of columns of H
%
%           R is a two element vector that specifies frequency limits (Hz), 
%             i.e., R = [ low_frequency high_frequency ];
%
%           FS is the sampling frequency (Hz)
%
%           H2W is a Hertz scale to warped scale function handle
%
%           W2H is a wared scale to Hertz scale function handle
%
%   Outputs
%           H is a M by K triangular filterbank matrix (one filter per row)
%
%           F is a frequency vector (Hz) of 1xK dimension
%
%           C is a vector of filter cutoff frequencies (Hz), 
%             note that C(2:end) also represents filter center frequencies,
%             and the dimension of C is 1x(M+2)
