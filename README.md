# Audio-Event-Features
This features set was implemented in my following works:

1. Early Event Detection in Audio Streams
  Huy Phan, Marco Maass, Radoslaw Mazur, and Alfred Mertins
  ICME 2015, Torino, Italy, July 2015 

2. Random Regression Forests for Acoustic Event Detection and Classification 
  Huy Phan, Marco Maass, Radoslaw Mazur, and Alfred Mertins, 
  IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing (TASLP): 23(1), pp. 20-31, January 2015
  
3. Acoustic Event Detection and Localization with Regression Forests    
  Huy Phan, Marco Maass, Radoslaw Mazur, and Alfred Mertins
  INTERSPEECH 2014, Singapore, September 2014
  
4. Exploring Superframe Co-occurrence for Acoustic Event Recognition    
  Huy Phan and Alfred Mertins
